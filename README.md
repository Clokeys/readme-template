# About the readme file

## Philosophy

The readme page is an overview or your library, script or app's content and a portal to all the related tools and information.

It should be as light as possible and not repeat information that can be found elsewhere. 
Remember that the readme is included with your package and therefore you should account for it's size. 
You may want to put in information that users will need when offline, in this case they can be added to the readme. Otherwise, favor links - for example: to the issues or milestones or Usage docs.

## Naming your Project

As fun and satisfying as it sounds to name your project whatever you can think of, it becomes a problem when everybody starts doing it. 
If you start looking for a specific project that accomplishes a certain task, but the name is something funky and not in link with the task whatsoever, it will be hard to find.

It also becomes more tedious for developpers joining a project with a bunch of funky-named dependencies. 

You should try to find a name that describes your project, even if it sounds a bit boring. Don't get lured by the Github repository name suggestions!

Also, please remember to add tags for categorizing your repo. For an npm package for example, you can add these tags in the `package.json` file

## Badges

Adding badges to your project shows integration, compliance and a lot of flashiness. It's a great indicator of the project's seriousness and reputation.

## Releases

Don't forget to create tags! Github creates nice binary packages for you when you push tags and can identify Dev builds and current releases.

## Instructions

Instructions for installation, launching, debug mode/debbugging, and testing should be in the readme or another markdown file within the project.
This way, if someone needs help running the app while offline, he can do so.

## Improvements

I'm looking for interested people to further improve this template/ readme guidelines project.
